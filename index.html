  <h2>Game guide</h2>
  <p>The main goal of the game is to lay out your dealt cards and collect as little cards as possible. There are 100 cards in the deck.</p>
  <p>To get rid off your cards you need to select a card and place it by dragging it in the middle of the table. 
    Cards will be put in the rows automatically by these rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Chosen card is placed in the end of row in ascending order next to card with closest number</li>
    <li>If there is no row with lower card, player has to choose which row to collect by clicking on it</li>
    <li>If suitable row has five cards, player has to collect all cards in that row and put his card in that row (it is done automatically)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Game is played until one of the player collects 10 cards. First player who collects 10 cards - loses.</p>
