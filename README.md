# Sixth Card

It is a simple card game created with a goal to put my Javascript knowledge into practice. For this purpose game has been written in plain Vanilla Javascript. To create this exercise project beside basic programming concepts I have used some functional programming paradigm ideas, recursive function calls, few ES6 features (arrow functions, promise for animate motion with css transition).
